# AdventOfCode2019
My attempts at the 2019 Advent of Code.  I plan to do this in Julia for practice

## Disclaimer
Since I am generally just solving this on the day of the assignment, my code may not be as optimized as it could be, and I probably won't refactor in the future to do so.  My goal is to get more familiar with some of the functions and syntax that Julia offers, much the same as how I did with Python for Advent of Code 2015.
